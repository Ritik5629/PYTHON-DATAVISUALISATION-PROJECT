# Olympic Athletes Data Visualization Project

This project, dataproject2.py, provides data visualization for Olympic athletes' performance based on regions, medal counts, and age distribution. It leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to generate multiple visualizations, offering insights into regional and individual-level performance.

## Project Structure

Main Script: dataproject2.py

Data File: Olympic Athletes.xlsx (an Excel file with Olympic athlete data)

Output Visualizations: Includes pie charts, bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and histograms.
## Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
## Getting Started
1)Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2)Install the required Python libraries if not already installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
3)Ensure Olympic Athletes.xlsx is located in the correct path or adjust the path in dataproject2.py if necessary.

4)Run the script to generate all visualizations:
